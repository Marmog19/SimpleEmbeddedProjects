# EmbeddedProjects
This repository contains all my embedded projects. The more complex ones will be stored in a separate repository of their own.

They are mostly developed using a STM32 board. The code was written with STM32Cube, but the more recent projects are built with CMake and flashed using ST-link tools from the terminal.
